          <p>2.1 What is prepaid fee fraud?</p>
          <p>Advance fee fraud is a scheme in which the victim pays before receiving something of value. This type of
            fraud can be done through fake websites, fake e-mails claiming to be from the company, or fake social media
            profiles. Scammers require &quot;a deposit&quot; to be deposited before a transaction can be completed.
            Victims never receive their product.</p>

            authorized to conduct business on behalf of Heart Of Nature. To make their plans seem authentic, Heart Of
            Nature&apos;s logo and business address using on fictitious contracts, email accounts create to mimic Heart
            Of Nature&apos;s official communications, and individuals may provide fraudulent identification documents

            claiming to sell these products, typically require a small percentage of orders to be sent to them normally
            via bank transfer. Once the money is sent, the money is usually not recoverable.</p>
          <p>Heart Of Nature generally does not use private messaging tools like WhatsApp, Gmail, Facebook, Facebook
            Messenger, or any other website to conduct business.</p>
          <p>If you find Heart Of Nature products on a Heart Of Nature website that is not on our listings, that site is
            not legitimate.</p>
          <p>If you believe you have been the victim of a fraudulent sales arrangement, please provide information to us

          <p>2.1. What is recruitment fraud?</p>
          <p>Recruitment fraud is a sophisticated scam that provides fake job opportunities to job seekers. This type of
            fraud can do through fake websites, fake e-mails claiming to be from the company or fake social media
            profiles. Scammers often ask recipients for personal information and payment as part of their counterfeit
            recruitment process.</p>

            States, check with your local government for resources to report and; or obtain extra protection.</p>
          <p>We are aware that job postings made by people claiming to be Heart Of Nature recruiters, even using Heart
            Of Nature employee names, but not affiliated with Heart Of Nature. We have also informed that unauthorized
            individuals may have been posing as Heart Of Nature recruiters, contacting about job opportunities, and
            extending job offers via text message, instant messages, or chat rooms. These job postings and job offers do
            not authorize by Heart Of Nature. Heart Of Nature is not responsible for fraudulent offers or claims for
            personal information.</p>
          <p>2.2. How to protect yourself from recruitment fraud</p>
          <p>We use the company&apos;s legitimate phone number and email to communicate with candidates about the
            company&apos;s employment information. You can visit our website&nbsp;<a
              href="http://heartofnature.us/contact-us">http://heartofnature.us/contact-us</a> to run with us, learn
            about jobs and apply.</p>
          <p>Be wary of employers asking candidates to submit unusual personal information like bank statements or
            utility bills, pay a fee to be considered for a job, or pay &quot;startup expenses&quot; after
            being&nbsp;recruited. Heart Of Nature does not use private messaging tools such as Google Hangouts, Gmail,
            Facebook, Facebook Messenger, or other similar tools to extend job offers.</p>
          <p>If you find a Heart Of Nature post on a site other than ours, verify the legitimacy of that site before
            applying by visiting our site and finding out.</p>
          <p>If you believe you are a victim of recruitment fraud, please share your information with us at&nbsp;<a
              href="http://heartofnature.us/contact-us">http://heartofnature.us/contact-us</a>. Thanks for your interest

          <p>Heart Of Nature Company is an organic agricultural mineral producer based in the state of Nevada in the
            USA. The company does not directly distribute products/sales to farmers or direct customers (referred
            &ldquo;end users&rdquo;) in any country and territory.</p>
          <p>We consider opening a branch or representative office in each country or territory. We cooperate with
            partners who are business enterprises with a reputation, management capacity, and experience in distributing
            organic agricultural mineral products to each of those countries or territories.</p>
          <p>We will provide a distributor search tool on the HON website soon.</p>
          <p>Please, contact us for assistance if you are concerned about an unauthorized distributor or commercial
            fraud.</p>
