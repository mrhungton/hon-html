              Foliar Application of SKMUF (-20 Microns) and Alga K18 to Tomato Plants

              Heart Of Nature Research and Development
            </h2>
            <p>
              <b>
                April 12, 2021, Acre, Inc. Laboratory and Greenhouse, Tucson, Arizona
              </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Background: SKMHUF and Alga K18 are products that can be applied to foliage to increase growth and
              ultimately yield. SKMUF has been reported to be effective when applied to corn and other crops. Alga K18
              has proven to increase yields of nuts of pecan and almond trees. Alga K18 has also been shown to increase
              flower size of cannabis plants. Previous studies with Alga K18 indicated that is was not effective when
              applied at 10 gallons per acre to plant foliage or to the seed furrow. This research was designed to
              determine the value of SKMUF and Alga K18 when applied to foliage separately and together. (Note that the
              previous evidence using Alga K18 indicates that 10 gallons per acre of total solution per acre is not an
              effective rate for 1 lb. and greater applications per acre.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Materials and Methods: Tomato plants with 4-5 true leaves were transplanted on March 22, 2021 in one
              gallon containers that contained a soilless medium: peat moss (20%), wood chips (20%) , pumice (60%) mix.
              This mixture has been used in previous experiments. Untreated check (UTC) plants were sprayed with water
              at approximately 10 gallons per acre. Foliage of treated plants were sprayed approximately 10 gallons per
              acre with 1 lb., 2.5. lb. and 5 lb. of SKMUF alone, or Alga K18 alone, all at equivalent rates per acre.
              SKMUF and Alga K18 were applied together at rates equal to 1 lb., 2.5 lb. and 5 lb. of each product. All
              treatments and the UTC consisted of 4 replications equaling at total of 40 tomato plants.
            </p>
            <p>Results: March 9, 2021 plants were removed from containers, roots were washed and dried. Plant shoot
              heights and fresh weights of roots and shoots were determined. Average heights and weights were calculated
              for all treatments and the UTC.
            </p>

              <b>Page 2, April 12, 2021, SKMUF and Alga K18 Treatments of Tomato Plants</b>
            </p>
            <p>SKMUF at 1.0 lb. per acre increased total growth as compared to all other treatments. SKMUF at 5 lb. per
              acre causes some minor leaf necrosis.
              <br>
              All treatment increased tomato plant growth compared to the UTC.
              <br>
              All treatments and the UTC consisted for 4 plants, except for treatments of Alga K18 at equivalent rates
              per acre 2.5 and 5 lb. that consisted of 3 plants per treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Conclusions:
              <br>
              SKMUF (20 microns minus) alone provided the most growth of tomato plants and should be used alone.
              Mixtures with other plant nutrients may be required to ensure that no phytotoxicity occurs from tank mixes
              with foliar fertilizers and other products. Small tests are needed prior to application of SKMUF with
              other nutrients and other materials.
              <br>
              SKMUF test results indicate that it has very high activity when applied to foliage.
              <br>
              All treatments Alga K18 combined with SKMUF did increase growth but is not of value at these rates
              compared to SKMUF.
              <br>
              Future Trials
              <br>
              SKMUF will be tested as in-furrow treatments for determination of pepper and corn seed germination and
              growth.
              <br>
              Alga K18 in typically used at higher water volumes that have been demonstrated to be effective when
              applied to foliage of pecan and almond trees.

              Objective: This trial was designed to determine the germination and growth rates of corn seeds planted
              in-furrow and treated with SKM Ultra Fine (SKMUF).
              <br>
              Materials and Methods: Tubs 4” deep x 9.5” wide x 13” long were filled with agriculture soil (Curry soil)
              to a depth of 3.5”. Furrows were 12” long and 1.5” deep. On April 16, 2021 six corn seeds were placed in
              each furrow and the SKMUF was added to the top of the seeds at ½ lb/ acre and 1 lb/ acre rate. The furrows
              were then covered with soil and tubs were watered to field capacity and watered as needed during the
              trial. Treatments and untreated checks (UTCs) consisted 3 replications of six plants each.

              June 22, 2021
              <br>
              Objective: The objective of these trials was to determine the corn plant response in soil amended with
              compost and SKMAG tilled into six inches of soil.
              <br>
              Materials and Methods: Dyna-Gro hybrid corn seeds, variety A1034226, were seeded in previously tested
              agriculture soil (Curry soil). One gallon containers were filled six inches deep, four replications per
              treatment and the UTC. Treatments were comprised of compost alone, SKMAG alone, and SKMAG plus compost
              (Source: Scotts Valley, CA) The UTC’s consisted of only Curry soil.
              <br>
              The ratio of SKMAG to compost is 1 ton per 5 tons, respectively. Equivalent acre rates of compost were
              6,000 lbs. and SKMAG at 1,200 lbs, equaling a total of 7,200 lbs total added per acre.
              <br>
              Soil and compost mixtures were made in a wheelbarrow prior to filling one gallon containers to obtain
              uniform distribution in the soil. Mixtures of soil and compost, SKMAG only and soil only represented the
              treatments. (Re: Tables 1, 2, 3, 4) Soil was irrigated as needed. Plants were grown for 35 days. Roots
              were gently rinsed and blotted dry. Metrics were heights, fresh weights of roots and shoots and total
              weights.

            </p>
            <p>
              Background: SKMHUF and Alga K18 are products that can be applied to foliage to increase growth and
              ultimately yield. SKMUF has been reported to be effective when applied to corn and other crops. Alga K18
              has proven to increase yields of nuts of pecan and almond trees. Alga K18 has also been shown to increase
              flower size of cannabis plants. Previous studies with Alga K18 indicated that is was not effective when
              applied at 10 gallons per acre to plant foliage or to the seed furrow. This research was designed to
              determine the value of SKMUF and Alga K18 when applied to foliage separately and together. (Note that the
              previous evidence using Alga K18 indicates that 10 gallons per acre of total solution per acre is not an
              effective rate for 1 lb. and greater applications per acre.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Materials and Methods: Tomato plants with 4-5 true leaves were transplanted on March 22, 2021 in one
              gallon containers that contained a soilless medium: peat moss (20%), wood chips (20%) , pumice (60%) mix.
              This mixture has been used in previous experiments. Untreated check (UTC) plants were sprayed with water
              at approximately 10 gallons per acre. Foliage of treated plants were sprayed approximately 10 gallons per
              acre with 1 lb., 2.5. lb. and 5 lb. of SKMUF alone, or Alga K18 alone, all at equivalent rates per acre.
              SKMUF and Alga K18 were applied together at rates equal to 1 lb., 2.5 lb. and 5 lb. of each product. All
              treatments and the UTC consisted of 4 replications equaling at total of 40 tomato plants.
            </p>
            <p>Results: March 9, 2021 plants were removed from containers, roots were washed and dried. Plant shoot
              heights and fresh weights of roots and shoots were determined. Average heights and weights were calculated
              for all treatments and the UTC.

              <b>Page 2, April 12, 2021, SKMUF and Alga K18 Treatments of Tomato Plants</b>
            </p>
            <p>SKMUF at 1.0 lb. per acre increased total growth as compared to all other treatments. SKMUF at 5 lb. per
              acre causes some minor leaf necrosis.
              <br>
              All treatment increased tomato plant growth compared to the UTC.
              <br>
              All treatments and the UTC consisted for 4 plants, except for treatments of Alga K18 at equivalent rates
              per acre 2.5 and 5 lb. that consisted of 3 plants per treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Conclusions:
              <br>
              SKMUF (20 microns minus) alone provided the most growth of tomato plants and should be used alone.
              Mixtures with other plant nutrients may be required to ensure that no phytotoxicity occurs from tank mixes
              with foliar fertilizers and other products. Small tests are needed prior to application of SKMUF with
              other nutrients and other materials.
              <br>
              SKMUF test results indicate that it has very high activity when applied to foliage.
              <br>
              All treatments Alga K18 combined with SKMUF did increase growth but is not of value at these rates
              compared to SKMUF.
              <br>
              Future Trials
              <br>
              SKMUF will be tested as in-furrow treatments for determination of pepper and corn seed germination and
              growth.
              <br>
              Alga K18 in typically used at higher water volumes that have been demonstrated to be effective when
              applied to foliage of pecan and almond trees.

              Objective: The objective of these trials was to determine the corn plant response in soil amended with
              compost and SKMAG tilled into six inches of soil.
              <br>
              Materials and Methods: Dyna-Gro hybrid corn seeds, variety A1034226, were seeded in previously tested
              agriculture soil (Curry soil). One gallon containers were filled six inches deep, four replications per
              treatment and the UTC. Treatments were comprised of compost alone, SKMAG alone, and SKMAG plus compost
              (Source: Scotts Valley, CA) The UTC’s consisted of only Curry soil.
              <br>
              The ratio of SKMAG to compost is 1 ton per 5 tons, respectively. Equivalent acre rates of compost were
              6,000 lbs. and SKMAG at 1,200 lbs, equaling a total of 7,200 lbs total added per acre.
              <br>
              Soil and compost mixtures were made in a wheelbarrow prior to filling one gallon containers to obtain
              uniform distribution in the soil. Mixtures of soil and compost, SKMAG only and soil only represented the
              treatments. (Re: Tables 1, 2, 3, 4) Soil was irrigated as needed. Plants were grown for 35 days. Roots
              were gently rinsed and blotted dry. Metrics were heights, fresh weights of roots and shoots and total
              weights.

            <p>
              Background: SKMHUF and Alga K18 are products that can be applied to foliage to increase growth and
              ultimately yield. SKMUF has been reported to be effective when applied to corn and other crops. Alga K18
              has proven to increase yields of nuts of pecan and almond trees. Alga K18 has also been shown to increase
              flower size of cannabis plants. Previous studies with Alga K18 indicated that is was not effective when
              applied at 10 gallons per acre to plant foliage or to the seed furrow. This research was designed to
              determine the value of SKMUF and Alga K18 when applied to foliage separately and together. (Note that the
              previous evidence using Alga K18 indicates that 10 gallons per acre of total solution per acre is not an
              effective rate for 1 lb. and greater applications per acre.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Materials and Methods: Tomato plants with 4-5 true leaves were transplanted on March 22, 2021 in one
              gallon containers that contained a soilless medium: peat moss (20%), wood chips (20%) , pumice (60%) mix.
              This mixture has been used in previous experiments. Untreated check (UTC) plants were sprayed with water
              at approximately 10 gallons per acre. Foliage of treated plants were sprayed approximately 10 gallons per
              acre with 1 lb., 2.5. lb. and 5 lb. of SKMUF alone, or Alga K18 alone, all at equivalent rates per acre.
              SKMUF and Alga K18 were applied together at rates equal to 1 lb., 2.5 lb. and 5 lb. of each product. All
              treatments and the UTC consisted of 4 replications equaling at total of 40 tomato plants.
            </p>
            <p>Results: March 9, 2021 plants were removed from containers, roots were washed and dried. Plant shoot
              heights and fresh weights of roots and shoots were determined. Average heights and weights were calculated
              for all treatments and the UTC.

            <p>SKMUF at 1.0 lb. per acre increased total growth as compared to all other treatments. SKMUF at 5 lb. per
              acre causes some minor leaf necrosis.
              <br>
              All treatment increased tomato plant growth compared to the UTC.
              <br>
              All treatments and the UTC consisted for 4 plants, except for treatments of Alga K18 at equivalent rates
              per acre 2.5 and 5 lb. that consisted of 3 plants per treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Conclusions:
              <br>
              SKMUF (20 microns minus) alone provided the most growth of tomato plants and should be used alone.
              Mixtures with other plant nutrients may be required to ensure that no phytotoxicity occurs from tank mixes
              with foliar fertilizers and other products. Small tests are needed prior to application of SKMUF with
              other nutrients and other materials.
              <br>
              SKMUF test results indicate that it has very high activity when applied to foliage.
              <br>
              All treatments Alga K18 combined with SKMUF did increase growth but is not of value at these rates
              compared to SKMUF.
              <br>
              Future Trials
              <br>
              SKMUF will be tested as in-furrow treatments for determination of pepper and corn seed germination and
              growth.
              <br>
              Alga K18 in typically used at higher water volumes that have been demonstrated to be effective when
              applied to foliage of pecan and almond trees.

              treatment and the UTC. Treatments were comprised of compost alone, SKMAG alone, and SKMAG plus compost
              (Source: Scotts Valley, CA) The UTC’s consisted of only Curry soil.
              <br>
              The ratio of SKMAG to compost is 1 ton per 5 tons, respectively. Equivalent acre rates of compost were
              6,000 lbs. and SKMAG at 1,200 lbs, equaling a total of 7,200 lbs total added per acre.
              <br>
              Soil and compost mixtures were made in a wheelbarrow prior to filling one gallon containers to obtain
              uniform distribution in the soil. Mixtures of soil and compost, SKMAG only and soil only represented the
              treatments. (Re: Tables 1, 2, 3, 4) Soil was irrigated as needed. Plants were grown for 35 days. Roots
              were gently rinsed and blotted dry. Metrics were heights, fresh weights of roots and shoots and total
              weights.

              Heart Of Nature Research and Development
            </h2>
            <p>
              <b>
                April 12, 2021, Acre, Inc. Laboratory and Greenhouse, Tucson, Arizona
              </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Background: SKMHUF and Alga K18 are products that can be applied to foliage to increase growth and
              ultimately yield. SKMUF has been reported to be effective when applied to corn and other crops. Alga K18
              has proven to increase yields of nuts of pecan and almond trees. Alga K18 has also been shown to increase
              flower size of cannabis plants. Previous studies with Alga K18 indicated that is was not effective when
              applied at 10 gallons per acre to plant foliage or to the seed furrow. This research was designed to
              determine the value of SKMUF and Alga K18 when applied to foliage separately and together. (Note that the
              previous evidence using Alga K18 indicates that 10 gallons per acre of total solution per acre is not an
              effective rate for 1 lb. and greater applications per acre.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Materials and Methods: Tomato plants with 4-5 true leaves were transplanted on March 22, 2021 in one
              gallon containers that contained a soilless medium: peat moss (20%), wood chips (20%) , pumice (60%) mix.
              This mixture has been used in previous experiments. Untreated check (UTC) plants were sprayed with water
              at approximately 10 gallons per acre. Foliage of treated plants were sprayed approximately 10 gallons per
              acre with 1 lb., 2.5. lb. and 5 lb. of SKMUF alone, or Alga K18 alone, all at equivalent rates per acre.
              SKMUF and Alga K18 were applied together at rates equal to 1 lb., 2.5 lb. and 5 lb. of each product. All
              treatments and the UTC consisted of 4 replications equaling at total of 40 tomato plants.
            </p>
            <p>Results: March 9, 2021 plants were removed from containers, roots were washed and dried. Plant shoot
              heights and fresh weights of roots and shoots were determined. Average heights and weights were calculated
              for all treatments and the UTC.
            </p>

              <b>Page 2, April 12, 2021, SKMUF and Alga K18 Treatments of Tomato Plants</b>
            </p>
            <p>SKMUF at 1.0 lb. per acre increased total growth as compared to all other treatments. SKMUF at 5 lb. per
              acre causes some minor leaf necrosis.
              <br>
              All treatment increased tomato plant growth compared to the UTC.
              <br>
              All treatments and the UTC consisted for 4 plants, except for treatments of Alga K18 at equivalent rates
              per acre 2.5 and 5 lb. that consisted of 3 plants per treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Conclusions:
              <br>
              SKMUF (20 microns minus) alone provided the most growth of tomato plants and should be used alone.
              Mixtures with other plant nutrients may be required to ensure that no phytotoxicity occurs from tank mixes
              with foliar fertilizers and other products. Small tests are needed prior to application of SKMUF with
              other nutrients and other materials.
              <br>
              SKMUF test results indicate that it has very high activity when applied to foliage.
              <br>
              All treatments Alga K18 combined with SKMUF did increase growth but is not of value at these rates
              compared to SKMUF.
              <br>
              Future Trials
              <br>
              SKMUF will be tested as in-furrow treatments for determination of pepper and corn seed germination and
              growth.
              <br>
              Alga K18 in typically used at higher water volumes that have been demonstrated to be effective when
              applied to foliage of pecan and almond trees.

              <br>
              Materials and Methods: Tubs 4” deep x 9.5” wide x 13” long were filled with agriculture soil (Curry soil)
              to a depth of 3.5”. Furrows were 12” long and 1.5” deep. On April 16, 2021 six corn seeds were placed in
              each furrow and the SKMUF was added to the top of the seeds at ½ lb/ acre and 1 lb/ acre rate. The furrows
              were then covered with soil and tubs were watered to field capacity and watered as needed during the
              trial. Treatments and untreated checks (UTCs) consisted 3 replications of six plants each.

              <br>
              Objective: The objective of these trials was to determine the corn plant response in soil amended with
              compost and SKMAG tilled into six inches of soil.
              <br>
              Materials and Methods: Dyna-Gro hybrid corn seeds, variety A1034226, were seeded in previously tested
              agriculture soil (Curry soil). One gallon containers were filled six inches deep, four replications per
              treatment and the UTC. Treatments were comprised of compost alone, SKMAG alone, and SKMAG plus compost
              (Source: Scotts Valley, CA) The UTC’s consisted of only Curry soil.
              <br>
              The ratio of SKMAG to compost is 1 ton per 5 tons, respectively. Equivalent acre rates of compost were
              6,000 lbs. and SKMAG at 1,200 lbs, equaling a total of 7,200 lbs total added per acre.
              <br>
              Soil and compost mixtures were made in a wheelbarrow prior to filling one gallon containers to obtain
              uniform distribution in the soil. Mixtures of soil and compost, SKMAG only and soil only represented the
              treatments. (Re: Tables 1, 2, 3, 4) Soil was irrigated as needed. Plants were grown for 35 days. Roots
              were gently rinsed and blotted dry. Metrics were heights, fresh weights of roots and shoots and total

            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The Origins and Evolution of Organic Agriculture&nbsp;</span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">The concept of organic agriculture was developed in the early 1900s by
                pioneers such as Franklin Hiram King, Rudolf Steiner, Robert Rodale, Sir Albert Howard, Eva Balfour, and
                others who believed that the use of animal feces (often made into organic fertilizer), cover crops, crop
                rotation, and biologically based pest control would lead to a better farming system. Their organic
                agriculture idea books were released in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. The books gradually perfected and
                defined biological movement and organic agriculture.</span></p>

            <p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-size:13pt;">EVE BALFOUR (1898-1990) British organic
                  farming pioneer&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style="font-size:13pt;"><br></span></em><em><span
                  style="font-size:13pt;">on a Ferguson tractor about 1925&nbsp;</span></em></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">As the actions of the pioneers expanded, a group of farmers in Europe and
                America began to grow in this direction. The organic producer model emerged in the 1940s and 1950s. In
                Europe, America, and Australia, the issue of inspection and supervision was raised and implemented, and
                organic standards and systems were established.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">The proponent of the organic movement label was Rudolf Steiner, and it was
                likely the first organic label ever developed. In 1967, the Soil Association, with the help of Ms. Eva
                Balfour, published the world&apos;s first standards for organic agricultural production. In 1970,
                organic products were introduced to the world for the first time.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">In the 1970s, various farm groups in the United States adopted the
                principles of organic agricultural production standards. Many organizations have created their own
                certification systems to ensure that organic products are produced in accordance with their
                requirements.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">In the late 1970s and early 1980s, certification agencies grew and expanded
                beyond national boundaries. Many accreditation programs were developed, such as producer accreditation.
                Most of these organizations engaged in activities other than certification. In the mid-1980s, a number
                of specialized certification agencies were formed, such as SKAL (Netherlands), KRAV (Sweden), and FVO
                (USA). Finally, in 1990, with the birth of the regulation, Regulations in Europe on organic
                certification became a concern towards commercialization, and certification companies were born.</span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">Certification agencies were developed, organic production standards and
                regulations were perfected, and the organic production movement grew worldwide. The International
                Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) has established fundamental standards and an
                accreditation program that is recognized as a common international guide to its standards and
                certification systems. Countries can be built on organic production.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">Organic production laws are currently in place. Organic production
                regulations were enacted in the US states of Oregon and California in 1970. In 1980, a variety of new
                organic products began to be introduced into Europe, and organic trade bodies in the United States
                expanded and soon crossed borders. In the United States, a law governing organic food production was
                enacted in 1990. Finally, the US Department of Agriculture established organic food regulations in
                December 2000, which went into effect in October 2000. 2002. In Europe, rule 2092/91 regulating organic
                foods was passed in 1991. Since 1992, countries have worked together to produce the Codex Alimentarius
                standard, which guides organic agriculture. Codex Alimentarius participates in the FAO/WTO mission on
                food standards. In 1999, the Codex Alimentarius rules for organic goods were adopted.</span></p>

                  class="img-fluid"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">Organic farms grew substantially in most European countries during the
                1990s. The overall area of organic production increased by 46.2% between 1988 and 1999. In recent years,
                Europe&apos;s total yearly organic area has expanded by an average of 30% per year. Three million
                hectares (survey data) were managed with more than 100,000 organic farms in numerous European nations at
                the beginning of the 2000s, accounting for up to 2% of agricultural land. Organic farming expanded from
                830 farms in 1990 to 5,300 farms producing organic crops in 2000.</span></p>

                  class="img-fluid"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">Organic product manufacturing continues to account for a very modest part
                of total food demand in the market. In most countries, the organic food market share is roughly 1% of
                absolute food sold. According to the results in the table below, Austria and Switzerland account for
                around 1.8 - 2%. Danish organic products account for 3% of the food in circulation.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">With the demands of the organic market in Europe, America, and Japan,
                developing countries must direct production activity to meet these demands. According to the data in the
                table above, it is projected that organic food and beverage sales in 2010 increased the yearly organic
                market by 10-25% depending on the country. The organic food market was worth about 16 billion USD in
                2000, and the global market is expected to be worth between 61 and 94 billion USD in 2010.</span></p>

                agricultural exports were valued at $177 billion in 2021, an 18 percent increase relative to 2020.
                Imports grew by almost 17 percent in 2021 to $171 billion. While the United States typically exports
                more agricultural goods by value than it imports, from 2012&ndash;21, imports grew more rapidly than
                exports (driven in part by strong domestic economic growth and consumer preferences for year-round

                constant since 2001.</span><strong><span style="font-size:13pt;"><br></span></strong></p>

            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">The U.S. share of agricultural consumption sourced from imports tends to be
                higher for higher-value agricultural product groups. This higher share is due to numerous
                factors&mdash;including the relative competitiveness in production, seasonal availability, consumer
                preferences, and others. Sweeteners, and processed sugar, and confections are groups of products where
                the United States is reliant on imports. Fruits, nuts, and vegetables are also frequently imported. The
                United States tends to have a lower reliance on imports for unprocessed commodities such as feed grains,
                livestock, and oilseeds. The total import share of consumption across all food and&nbsp;</span><span

            <h1><span style="font-size:24pt;">Overview of Agriculture in the United States</span></h1>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">America boasts the world&apos;s most advanced and modern agricultural
                industry. Agricultural laborers make up around 1% of the 322 million-person population. In terms of the
                labor force, agricultural workers in the United States accounted for only 0.7% of the total US
                employment in 2014 (155,421,000 individuals).</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The total area of the United States is 9,161,923 km2, with cultivable land
                accounting for 18.1%. According to US Department of Agriculture statistics, the US had 2,109,363 total
                farms in February 2014, with an average area of 174 hectares per farm.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">In 2012, the overall value of agricultural products reached 394.6 billion
                USD, a 33% increase over 2007, with crop products accounting for 219.6 billion USD and livestock
                products accounting for 171.7 billion USD.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The United States is the world&apos;s top importer and exporter of
                agricultural products, accounting for an estimated 18% of global agricultural trade. From 1960 to 2014,
                the United States consistently had a trade surplus in agriculture items. Agricultural exports, for
                example, were anticipated to reach 149.5 billion USD in 2014, accounting for more than 10% of the total
                export turnover of all products, and the agricultural trade surplus was more than 38.5 billion
                USD.</span></p>
            <h1><span style="font-size:24pt;">Reasons for a thriving agricultural industry</span></h1>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">Below are some reasons why America has such a small percentage of farmers
                compared to the total workforce yet has such a powerful agricultural industry.</span></p>
            <h2><span style="font-size: 13pt;">1- The government&apos;s agricultural assistance
                policy</span></h2>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;"><img
                  alt="C:\Users\tuant\Downloads\image-from-rawpixel-id-12059218-jpeg.jpg"

                  width="624" height="416"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The agricultural industry in the United States has thrived as a result of
                the US government&apos;s agricultural development programs. From the outset, the government enacted a
                land law in 1862 that granted free land to those who came to live and work on vacant property in the
                American West, allowing some farmers to easily settle down and start a business.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The agricultural industry in the United States has thrived as a result of
                the US government&apos;s agricultural development programs. From the outset, the government enacted a
                land law in 1862 that granted free land to those who came to live and work on vacant property in the
                American West, allowing some farmers to easily settle down and start a business.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The Agricultural Development Service was established by the United States
                Congress in 1914 to advise farmers on the application of fertilizer and the subsequent stages of the
                process to increase agricultural output. The Ministry of Agriculture is in charge of innovative
                research, fertilizer production to boost grain yields, hybrid types for stronger plants, and treatments
                to preserve and cure plants and animals, disease prevention, and a variety of additional pest-control
                approaches.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">President Herbert Hoover established a federal agricultural board in 1929
                to protect farmers&apos; economic security. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the
                installation of a price subsidy system for farmers at a price comparable to the market&apos;s regular
                stable conditions. Between 1933 and 1996, the government lent money to farmers for farming purposes, and
                farmers had the right to repay the debt at the price indicated in the contract. Furthermore, farmers had
                the right to sell surplus products to the government when agricultural prices were high, and to food
                trading companies when agricultural prices were low.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">Furthermore, the government promotes programs to protect and nourish
                reserve land. Large-scale intervention in the agriculture industry in the United States persisted until
                the late 1990s. Following that, agricultural price subsidies remained modest, and the government
                concentrated on the strategic reserve program, natural disaster prevention, environmental protection,
                and scientific research in order to support the US agricultural industry successfully.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The government is currently focusing on agricultural exports and is
                particularly concerned about the sustainability of agricultural labor. The Senate recently passed an
                immigration measure aimed at ensuring that there are enough employees for agriculture, particularly
                during harvest season, livestock raising, and agricultural product production for export. This statute
                also allows persons working in the US agricultural industry who do not have valid documentation to come
                to the US.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">It is due to these successful support measures that the US agricultural
                industry has achieved its current success.</span></p>
            <h2><span style="font-size: 13pt;">2 - Farmers&apos; independence and initiative</span>
            </h2>

                  width="624" height="416"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">From a historical standpoint, American farmers are viewed as
                self-sufficient, industrious, innovative, patient, and enthusiastic. At first, these farmers arrived in
                America with little, working on property they did not own.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">In 1790, farmers comprised about 90% of the population in the United
                States. By 1920, American farmers accounted for 30.8% of the total population, by 1960, they accounted
                for 8.3%, and as of 2014, the estimated number of farmers Americans actually working on the fields
                accounted for only about 1% of the total American population.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">These farmers own and operate small and medium-sized family farms or
                self-owned businesses, accounting for up to 95% of the total cultivated agricultural land area, with
                large corporations owning the remaining 5%.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">American farmers are highly skilled in the use of machinery, have extensive
                understanding of agriculture and economics, and many hold university degrees. They have concentrated on
                upgrading farming and cattle-raising techniques, resulting in a significant boost in agricultural
                output. Today&apos;s image of the American farmer is that of an agricultural worker who often wears
                jeans and checkered shirts and resides in fully equipped apartments.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">Agricultural laborers in the United States earn a good living; the current
                average compensation of an American agricultural worker is $61,000 per year. In 1960, the average income
                of a farming family was $4,654 per household. The average salary in 2012 was $108,814, an increase of
                23.38 times over 52 years.</span></p>

                  width="624" height="416"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">America places a specific emphasis on the mechanization of farming, which
                involves employing technology to replace human and animal labor. Machinery expenditures constitute a
                significant component of total investment costs in agricultural production. Mechanization involves not
                only increasing the number of machines in the field, but also focusing on combining features to build
                entire machines, such as merging tractors with plows and planting machines, or initiatives on machines
                that can farm in terrain that humans cannot.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">Machines are used in almost every aspect of agricultural production, from
                tillage to planting, fertilizing, irrigating, and harvesting. Aerial spraying of insecticides is also
                employed by farmers, as is computer monitoring of harvest data. Farmers now often drive tractors with
                air-conditioned cabs, equipped with quick and expensive plows, cultivators, and harvesters.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">It took four farmers at the turn of the twentieth century to produce enough
                food to feed ten people. Today, one American farmer can feed 100 Americans and 32 people in other
                nations across the world.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">With a large amount of farmed land, the use of modern agricultural tools
                and techniques has resulted in a significant increase in labor productivity. Furthermore, while there
                are floods and droughts, there is generally enough rainwater, river water, and groundwater to support
                irrigation in water-stressed areas. The western area of the Central United States is rich in
                agricultural land. As a result, when visitors come to America, they often see large, green, expansive
                fields of maize, soybeans, wheat, oranges, and grass fields.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">For the reasons stated above, the US agricultural industry has made great
                strides, playing an important role in the US economy by providing abundant food at low prices and
                creating more jobs in processing industries, machinery manufacturing, and agricultural export services
                to countries all over the world.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The Origins and Evolution of Organic Agriculture&nbsp;</span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">The concept of organic agriculture was developed in the early 1900s by
                pioneers such as Franklin Hiram King, Rudolf Steiner, Robert Rodale, Sir Albert Howard, Eva Balfour, and
                others who believed that the use of animal feces (often made into organic fertilizer), cover crops, crop
                rotation, and biologically based pest control would lead to a better farming system. Their organic
                agriculture idea books were released in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. The books gradually perfected and
                defined biological movement and organic agriculture.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:13pt;"><img

                  class="img-fluid"></span></p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-size:13pt;">EVE BALFOUR (1898-1990) British organic
                  farming pioneer&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style="font-size:13pt;"><br></span></em><em><span
                  style="font-size:13pt;">on a Ferguson tractor about 1925&nbsp;</span></em></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">As the actions of the pioneers expanded, a group of farmers in Europe and
                America began to grow in this direction. The organic producer model emerged in the 1940s and 1950s. In
                Europe, America, and Australia, the issue of inspection and supervision was raised and implemented, and
                organic standards and systems were established.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">The proponent of the organic movement label was Rudolf Steiner, and it was
                likely the first organic label ever developed. In 1967, the Soil Association, with the help of Ms. Eva
                Balfour, published the world&apos;s first standards for organic agricultural production. In 1970,
                organic products were introduced to the world for the first time.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">In the 1970s, various farm groups in the United States adopted the
                principles of organic agricultural production standards. Many organizations have created their own
                certification systems to ensure that organic products are produced in accordance with their
                requirements.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">In the late 1970s and early 1980s, certification agencies grew and expanded
                beyond national boundaries. Many accreditation programs were developed, such as producer accreditation.
                Most of these organizations engaged in activities other than certification. In the mid-1980s, a number
                of specialized certification agencies were formed, such as SKAL (Netherlands), KRAV (Sweden), and FVO
                (USA). Finally, in 1990, with the birth of the regulation, Regulations in Europe on organic
                certification became a concern towards commercialization, and certification companies were born.</span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">Certification agencies were developed, organic production standards and
                regulations were perfected, and the organic production movement grew worldwide. The International
                Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) has established fundamental standards and an
                accreditation program that is recognized as a common international guide to its standards and
                certification systems. Countries can be built on organic production.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">Organic production laws are currently in place. Organic production
                regulations were enacted in the US states of Oregon and California in 1970. In 1980, a variety of new
                organic products began to be introduced into Europe, and organic trade bodies in the United States
                expanded and soon crossed borders. In the United States, a law governing organic food production was
                enacted in 1990. Finally, the US Department of Agriculture established organic food regulations in
                December 2000, which went into effect in October 2000. 2002. In Europe, rule 2092/91 regulating organic
                foods was passed in 1991. Since 1992, countries have worked together to produce the Codex Alimentarius
                standard, which guides organic agriculture. Codex Alimentarius participates in the FAO/WTO mission on
                food standards. In 1999, the Codex Alimentarius rules for organic goods were adopted.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">Organic farms grew substantially in most European countries during the
                1990s. The overall area of organic production increased by 46.2% between 1988 and 1999. In recent years,
                Europe&apos;s total yearly organic area has expanded by an average of 30% per year. Three million
                hectares (survey data) were managed with more than 100,000 organic farms in numerous European nations at
                the beginning of the 2000s, accounting for up to 2% of agricultural land. Organic farming expanded from
                830 farms in 1990 to 5,300 farms producing organic crops in 2000.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">Organic product manufacturing continues to account for a very modest part
                of total food demand in the market. In most countries, the organic food market share is roughly 1% of
                absolute food sold. According to the results in the table below, Austria and Switzerland account for
                around 1.8 - 2%. Danish organic products account for 3% of the food in circulation.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">With the demands of the organic market in Europe, America, and Japan,
                developing countries must direct production activity to meet these demands. According to the data in the
                table above, it is projected that organic food and beverage sales in 2010 increased the yearly organic
                market by 10-25% depending on the country. The organic food market was worth about 16 billion USD in
                2000, and the global market is expected to be worth between 61 and 94 billion USD in 2010.</span></p>

            <h1><span style="font-size:24pt;">Overview of Agriculture in the United States</span></h1>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">America boasts the world&apos;s most advanced and modern agricultural
                industry. Agricultural laborers make up around 1% of the 322 million-person population. In terms of the
                labor force, agricultural workers in the United States accounted for only 0.7% of the total US
                employment in 2014 (155,421,000 individuals).</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The total area of the United States is 9,161,923 km2, with cultivable land
                accounting for 18.1%. According to US Department of Agriculture statistics, the US had 2,109,363 total
                farms in February 2014, with an average area of 174 hectares per farm.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">In 2012, the overall value of agricultural products reached 394.6 billion
                USD, a 33% increase over 2007, with crop products accounting for 219.6 billion USD and livestock
                products accounting for 171.7 billion USD.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The United States is the world&apos;s top importer and exporter of
                agricultural products, accounting for an estimated 18% of global agricultural trade. From 1960 to 2014,
                the United States consistently had a trade surplus in agriculture items. Agricultural exports, for
                example, were anticipated to reach 149.5 billion USD in 2014, accounting for more than 10% of the total
                export turnover of all products, and the agricultural trade surplus was more than 38.5 billion
                USD.</span></p>
            <h1><span style="font-size:24pt;">Reasons for a thriving agricultural industry</span></h1>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">Below are some reasons why America has such a small percentage of farmers
                compared to the total workforce yet has such a powerful agricultural industry.</span></p>
            <h2><span style="font-size: 13pt;">1- The government&apos;s agricultural assistance
                policy</span></h2>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;"><img
                  alt="C:\Users\tuant\Downloads\image-from-rawpixel-id-12059218-jpeg.jpg"

                  width="624" height="416"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The agricultural industry in the United States has thrived as a result of
                the US government&apos;s agricultural development programs. From the outset, the government enacted a
                land law in 1862 that granted free land to those who came to live and work on vacant property in the
                American West, allowing some farmers to easily settle down and start a business.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The agricultural industry in the United States has thrived as a result of
                the US government&apos;s agricultural development programs. From the outset, the government enacted a
                land law in 1862 that granted free land to those who came to live and work on vacant property in the
                American West, allowing some farmers to easily settle down and start a business.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The Agricultural Development Service was established by the United States
                Congress in 1914 to advise farmers on the application of fertilizer and the subsequent stages of the
                process to increase agricultural output. The Ministry of Agriculture is in charge of innovative
                research, fertilizer production to boost grain yields, hybrid types for stronger plants, and treatments
                to preserve and cure plants and animals, disease prevention, and a variety of additional pest-control
                approaches.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">President Herbert Hoover established a federal agricultural board in 1929
                to protect farmers&apos; economic security. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the
                installation of a price subsidy system for farmers at a price comparable to the market&apos;s regular
                stable conditions. Between 1933 and 1996, the government lent money to farmers for farming purposes, and
                farmers had the right to repay the debt at the price indicated in the contract. Furthermore, farmers had
                the right to sell surplus products to the government when agricultural prices were high, and to food
                trading companies when agricultural prices were low.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">Furthermore, the government promotes programs to protect and nourish
                reserve land. Large-scale intervention in the agriculture industry in the United States persisted until
                the late 1990s. Following that, agricultural price subsidies remained modest, and the government
                concentrated on the strategic reserve program, natural disaster prevention, environmental protection,
                and scientific research in order to support the US agricultural industry successfully.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The government is currently focusing on agricultural exports and is
                particularly concerned about the sustainability of agricultural labor. The Senate recently passed an
                immigration measure aimed at ensuring that there are enough employees for agriculture, particularly
                during harvest season, livestock raising, and agricultural product production for export. This statute
                also allows persons working in the US agricultural industry who do not have valid documentation to come
                to the US.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">It is due to these successful support measures that the US agricultural
                industry has achieved its current success.</span></p>
            <h2><span style="font-size: 13pt;">2 - Farmers&apos; independence and initiative</span>
            </h2>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;"><img

                  width="624" height="416"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">From a historical standpoint, American farmers are viewed as
                self-sufficient, industrious, innovative, patient, and enthusiastic. At first, these farmers arrived in
                America with little, working on property they did not own.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">In 1790, farmers comprised about 90% of the population in the United
                States. By 1920, American farmers accounted for 30.8% of the total population, by 1960, they accounted
                for 8.3%, and as of 2014, the estimated number of farmers Americans actually working on the fields
                accounted for only about 1% of the total American population.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">These farmers own and operate small and medium-sized family farms or
                self-owned businesses, accounting for up to 95% of the total cultivated agricultural land area, with
                large corporations owning the remaining 5%.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">American farmers are highly skilled in the use of machinery, have extensive
                understanding of agriculture and economics, and many hold university degrees. They have concentrated on
                upgrading farming and cattle-raising techniques, resulting in a significant boost in agricultural
                output. Today&apos;s image of the American farmer is that of an agricultural worker who often wears
                jeans and checkered shirts and resides in fully equipped apartments.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">Agricultural laborers in the United States earn a good living; the current
                average compensation of an American agricultural worker is $61,000 per year. In 1960, the average income
                of a farming family was $4,654 per household. The average salary in 2012 was $108,814, an increase of
                23.38 times over 52 years.</span></p>
            <h2><span style="font-size: 13pt;">3 - Utilize contemporary agricultural production
                methods and techniques.</span></h2>

                  width="624" height="416"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">America places a specific emphasis on the mechanization of farming, which
                involves employing technology to replace human and animal labor. Machinery expenditures constitute a
                significant component of total investment costs in agricultural production. Mechanization involves not
                only increasing the number of machines in the field, but also focusing on combining features to build
                entire machines, such as merging tractors with plows and planting machines, or initiatives on machines
                that can farm in terrain that humans cannot.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">Machines are used in almost every aspect of agricultural production, from
                tillage to planting, fertilizing, irrigating, and harvesting. Aerial spraying of insecticides is also
                employed by farmers, as is computer monitoring of harvest data. Farmers now often drive tractors with
                air-conditioned cabs, equipped with quick and expensive plows, cultivators, and harvesters.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">It took four farmers at the turn of the twentieth century to produce enough
                food to feed ten people. Today, one American farmer can feed 100 Americans and 32 people in other
                nations across the world.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">With a large amount of farmed land, the use of modern agricultural tools
                and techniques has resulted in a significant increase in labor productivity. Furthermore, while there
                are floods and droughts, there is generally enough rainwater, river water, and groundwater to support
                irrigation in water-stressed areas. The western area of the Central United States is rich in
                agricultural land. As a result, when visitors come to America, they often see large, green, expansive
                fields of maize, soybeans, wheat, oranges, and grass fields.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">For the reasons stated above, the US agricultural industry has made great
                strides, playing an important role in the US economy by providing abundant food at low prices and
                creating more jobs in processing industries, machinery manufacturing, and agricultural export services
                to countries all over the world.</span></p>

            </p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">The concept of organic agriculture was developed in the early 1900s by
                pioneers such as Franklin Hiram King, Rudolf Steiner, Robert Rodale, Sir Albert Howard, Eva Balfour, and
                others who believed that the use of animal feces (often made into organic fertilizer), cover crops, crop
                rotation, and biologically based pest control would lead to a better farming system. Their organic
                agriculture idea books were released in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. The books gradually perfected and
                defined biological movement and organic agriculture.</span></p>

                  style="font-size:13pt;">on a Ferguson tractor about 1925&nbsp;</span></em></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">As the actions of the pioneers expanded, a group of farmers in Europe and
                America began to grow in this direction. The organic producer model emerged in the 1940s and 1950s. In
                Europe, America, and Australia, the issue of inspection and supervision was raised and implemented, and
                organic standards and systems were established.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">The proponent of the organic movement label was Rudolf Steiner, and it was
                likely the first organic label ever developed. In 1967, the Soil Association, with the help of Ms. Eva
                Balfour, published the world&apos;s first standards for organic agricultural production. In 1970,
                organic products were introduced to the world for the first time.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">In the 1970s, various farm groups in the United States adopted the
                principles of organic agricultural production standards. Many organizations have created their own
                certification systems to ensure that organic products are produced in accordance with their
                requirements.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">In the late 1970s and early 1980s, certification agencies grew and expanded
                beyond national boundaries. Many accreditation programs were developed, such as producer accreditation.
                Most of these organizations engaged in activities other than certification. In the mid-1980s, a number
                of specialized certification agencies were formed, such as SKAL (Netherlands), KRAV (Sweden), and FVO
                (USA). Finally, in 1990, with the birth of the regulation, Regulations in Europe on organic
                certification became a concern towards commercialization, and certification companies were born.</span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">Certification agencies were developed, organic production standards and
                regulations were perfected, and the organic production movement grew worldwide. The International
                Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) has established fundamental standards and an
                accreditation program that is recognized as a common international guide to its standards and
                certification systems. Countries can be built on organic production.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">Organic production laws are currently in place. Organic production
                regulations were enacted in the US states of Oregon and California in 1970. In 1980, a variety of new
                organic products began to be introduced into Europe, and organic trade bodies in the United States
                expanded and soon crossed borders. In the United States, a law governing organic food production was
                enacted in 1990. Finally, the US Department of Agriculture established organic food regulations in
                December 2000, which went into effect in October 2000. 2002. In Europe, rule 2092/91 regulating organic
                foods was passed in 1991. Since 1992, countries have worked together to produce the Codex Alimentarius
                standard, which guides organic agriculture. Codex Alimentarius participates in the FAO/WTO mission on
                food standards. In 1999, the Codex Alimentarius rules for organic goods were adopted.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">Organic farms grew substantially in most European countries during the
                1990s. The overall area of organic production increased by 46.2% between 1988 and 1999. In recent years,
                Europe&apos;s total yearly organic area has expanded by an average of 30% per year. Three million
                hectares (survey data) were managed with more than 100,000 organic farms in numerous European nations at
                the beginning of the 2000s, accounting for up to 2% of agricultural land. Organic farming expanded from
                830 farms in 1990 to 5,300 farms producing organic crops in 2000.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">Organic product manufacturing continues to account for a very modest part
                of total food demand in the market. In most countries, the organic food market share is roughly 1% of
                absolute food sold. According to the results in the table below, Austria and Switzerland account for
                around 1.8 - 2%. Danish organic products account for 3% of the food in circulation.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13pt;">With the demands of the organic market in Europe, America, and Japan,
                developing countries must direct production activity to meet these demands. According to the data in the
                table above, it is projected that organic food and beverage sales in 2010 increased the yearly organic
                market by 10-25% depending on the country. The organic food market was worth about 16 billion USD in
                2000, and the global market is expected to be worth between 61 and 94 billion USD in 2010.</span></p>

            <h1><span style="font-size:24pt;">Overview of Agriculture in the United States</span></h1>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">America boasts the world&apos;s most advanced and modern agricultural
                industry. Agricultural laborers make up around 1% of the 322 million-person population. In terms of the
                labor force, agricultural workers in the United States accounted for only 0.7% of the total US
                employment in 2014 (155,421,000 individuals).</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The total area of the United States is 9,161,923 km2, with cultivable land
                accounting for 18.1%. According to US Department of Agriculture statistics, the US had 2,109,363 total
                farms in February 2014, with an average area of 174 hectares per farm.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">In 2012, the overall value of agricultural products reached 394.6 billion
                USD, a 33% increase over 2007, with crop products accounting for 219.6 billion USD and livestock
                products accounting for 171.7 billion USD.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The United States is the world&apos;s top importer and exporter of
                agricultural products, accounting for an estimated 18% of global agricultural trade. From 1960 to 2014,
                the United States consistently had a trade surplus in agriculture items. Agricultural exports, for
                example, were anticipated to reach 149.5 billion USD in 2014, accounting for more than 10% of the total
                export turnover of all products, and the agricultural trade surplus was more than 38.5 billion
                USD.</span></p>
            <h1><span style="font-size:24pt;">Reasons for a thriving agricultural industry</span></h1>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">Below are some reasons why America has such a small percentage of farmers
                compared to the total workforce yet has such a powerful agricultural industry.</span></p>
            <h2><span style="font-size: 13pt;">1- The government&apos;s agricultural assistance
                policy</span></h2>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;"><img
                  alt="C:\Users\tuant\Downloads\image-from-rawpixel-id-12059218-jpeg.jpg"
                  src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vVXbbnZ9beMooGBJts5JT9D62qEOXeCgt4oVZtD6k4HCiVp-CXdDNCVXkX7ch7WnY4yrC9V8ca9la2DktS9LjqsaPzSwwALoMUr11EkwEM2ngjtUTTpNTkxq3pcLBVL_spmMdb747tjDtXWF-SG_pg"
                  width="624" height="416"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The agricultural industry in the United States has thrived as a result of
                the US government&apos;s agricultural development programs. From the outset, the government enacted a
                land law in 1862 that granted free land to those who came to live and work on vacant property in the
                American West, allowing some farmers to easily settle down and start a business.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The agricultural industry in the United States has thrived as a result of
                the US government&apos;s agricultural development programs. From the outset, the government enacted a
                land law in 1862 that granted free land to those who came to live and work on vacant property in the
                American West, allowing some farmers to easily settle down and start a business.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The Agricultural Development Service was established by the United States
                Congress in 1914 to advise farmers on the application of fertilizer and the subsequent stages of the
                process to increase agricultural output. The Ministry of Agriculture is in charge of innovative
                research, fertilizer production to boost grain yields, hybrid types for stronger plants, and treatments
                to preserve and cure plants and animals, disease prevention, and a variety of additional pest-control
                approaches.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">President Herbert Hoover established a federal agricultural board in 1929
                to protect farmers&apos; economic security. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the
                installation of a price subsidy system for farmers at a price comparable to the market&apos;s regular
                stable conditions. Between 1933 and 1996, the government lent money to farmers for farming purposes, and
                farmers had the right to repay the debt at the price indicated in the contract. Furthermore, farmers had
                the right to sell surplus products to the government when agricultural prices were high, and to food
                trading companies when agricultural prices were low.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">Furthermore, the government promotes programs to protect and nourish
                reserve land. Large-scale intervention in the agriculture industry in the United States persisted until
                the late 1990s. Following that, agricultural price subsidies remained modest, and the government
                concentrated on the strategic reserve program, natural disaster prevention, environmental protection,
                and scientific research in order to support the US agricultural industry successfully.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">The government is currently focusing on agricultural exports and is
                particularly concerned about the sustainability of agricultural labor. The Senate recently passed an
                immigration measure aimed at ensuring that there are enough employees for agriculture, particularly
                during harvest season, livestock raising, and agricultural product production for export. This statute
                also allows persons working in the US agricultural industry who do not have valid documentation to come
                to the US.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">It is due to these successful support measures that the US agricultural
                industry has achieved its current success.</span></p>
            <h2><span style="font-size: 13pt;">2 - Farmers&apos; independence and initiative</span>
            </h2>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;"><img

                  width="624" height="416"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">From a historical standpoint, American farmers are viewed as
                self-sufficient, industrious, innovative, patient, and enthusiastic. At first, these farmers arrived in
                America with little, working on property they did not own.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">In 1790, farmers comprised about 90% of the population in the United
                States. By 1920, American farmers accounted for 30.8% of the total population, by 1960, they accounted
                for 8.3%, and as of 2014, the estimated number of farmers Americans actually working on the fields
                accounted for only about 1% of the total American population.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">These farmers own and operate small and medium-sized family farms or
                self-owned businesses, accounting for up to 95% of the total cultivated agricultural land area, with
                large corporations owning the remaining 5%.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">American farmers are highly skilled in the use of machinery, have extensive
                understanding of agriculture and economics, and many hold university degrees. They have concentrated on
                upgrading farming and cattle-raising techniques, resulting in a significant boost in agricultural
                output. Today&apos;s image of the American farmer is that of an agricultural worker who often wears
                jeans and checkered shirts and resides in fully equipped apartments.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">Agricultural laborers in the United States earn a good living; the current
                average compensation of an American agricultural worker is $61,000 per year. In 1960, the average income
                of a farming family was $4,654 per household. The average salary in 2012 was $108,814, an increase of
                23.38 times over 52 years.</span></p>
            <h2><span style="font-size: 13pt;">3 - Utilize contemporary agricultural production
                methods and techniques.</span></h2>

                  width="624" height="416"></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">America places a specific emphasis on the mechanization of farming, which
                involves employing technology to replace human and animal labor. Machinery expenditures constitute a
                significant component of total investment costs in agricultural production. Mechanization involves not
                only increasing the number of machines in the field, but also focusing on combining features to build
                entire machines, such as merging tractors with plows and planting machines, or initiatives on machines
                that can farm in terrain that humans cannot.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">Machines are used in almost every aspect of agricultural production, from
                tillage to planting, fertilizing, irrigating, and harvesting. Aerial spraying of insecticides is also
                employed by farmers, as is computer monitoring of harvest data. Farmers now often drive tractors with
                air-conditioned cabs, equipped with quick and expensive plows, cultivators, and harvesters.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">It took four farmers at the turn of the twentieth century to produce enough
                food to feed ten people. Today, one American farmer can feed 100 Americans and 32 people in other
                nations across the world.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">With a large amount of farmed land, the use of modern agricultural tools
                and techniques has resulted in a significant increase in labor productivity. Furthermore, while there
                are floods and droughts, there is generally enough rainwater, river water, and groundwater to support
                irrigation in water-stressed areas. The western area of the Central United States is rich in
                agricultural land. As a result, when visitors come to America, they often see large, green, expansive
                fields of maize, soybeans, wheat, oranges, and grass fields.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:16pt;">For the reasons stated above, the US agricultural industry has made great
                strides, playing an important role in the US economy by providing abundant food at low prices and
                creating more jobs in processing industries, machinery manufacturing, and agricultural export services
                to countries all over the world.</span></p>
